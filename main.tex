\section{Introduction}

We have implemented a horizontal streamflow scheme representing the streamflow flux between the land and ocean model components within the recently developed Regional Arctic System Model [RASM; Maslowski et al. In prep].
In this paper, we introduce the RVIC streamflow routing model and describe its coupling within RASM.
We evaluate the performance of RVIC in fully-coupled RASM simulations, comparing model simulated streamflows to in-situ observations.
We then highlight the role of the streamflow flux in the ocean and sea-ice components in RASM, utilizing a set of sensitivity experiements aimed at understanding the importance of accurately representing streamflow in coupled climate simulations in the Arctic.

Approximately 11\% of the global terestrial runoff drains into the Arctic Ocean, which holds only 1\% of the Earth's saltwater \citep{Lewis_2000,Lammers_2001}.
Streamflow is the largest contributor of freshwater to the Arctic Ocean and making up approximately 38\% of the total freshwater freshwater flux entering the Arctic Ocean \citep{Serreze_2006}.
During the spring and summer months, the fractional contribution of freshwater to the Arctic from streamflow is much larger.
Across the Arctic region, the annual runoff hydrograph is characterized by a prominent spring freshet, with approximately 60\% of the annual runoff volume occurring between April and July \citep{Lammers_2001}.

The seasonal freshwater flux from the land to the ocean can play an important role in coastal ocean dynamics and hydrography, as well as to sea ice formation and melt \citep{Rabe_2011,Fichot_2013}.
Runoff from Arctic river basins is the primary source of buoyancy-driven currents such as the Alaska, Siberian, Norwegian, and East Greenland coastal currents \citep[e.g.][]{Morison_2000,Boyd_2002,McGeehan_2012}.
Such currents redistribute both fresh water and heat, which locally play important roles in shelf dynamics and shelf-basin interactions.
Another important aspect is the effect of buoyancy delivered by rivers on the onset of sea ice formation in winter and melt in spring/summer [need to cite].
Less salty water freezes at higher temperatures, and therefor does not have to be cooled as much as higher salinity water to freeze.
Thus, for a warming and freshening Arctic, the onset of freezing in areas highly influenced by streamflow may be partially buffered against regional warming.

Long-term river runoff maintains the surface freshwater layer in the Arctic Ocean and is necessary to balance freshwater export through Fram Strait and the Canadian Arctic Archipelago into the North Atlantic [need to cite].
This freshwater layer is also important for mantaining the stratified structure of the Arctic Ocean \citep{Nummelin_2015}.
Although warmer water (less dense) exists at depth in the Arctic Ocean, stratification is mantained by the density differences between the fresh mixed layer and the more saline halacine and Atlantic water layers.
These stratifying processes serves to limit the heat flux into the mixed layer from below.

% [ocean / sea ice specific studies]
The importance of the terestrial freshwater flux has been shown to be an important driver of ice-ocean dynamics in coupled ice-ocean models.
\citet{Newton_2008} applied observed climatological runoff at the largest nine rivers in the Arctic basin and used dye tracers to visualize the spatial distribution of runoff; finding the highest concetrations of river runoff along the Siberian coast.
Despite our understanding of the importance of river runoff in Arctic Ocean dynamics, \citet{Nummelin_2015} show that fully-coupled global climate models (GCMs) poorly represent the vertical structure of the Arctic Ocean, with many models failing to accurately reproduce the observed profiles of temperature and salinity in the upper 500 m.

Numerous observational and modeling studies have explored the seasonal and inter-annual behavior of Arctic runoff.
\citet{Lammers_2001} compiled the R-ArcticNET database, a regional hydrographic record of monthly mean streamflow observations, including over 3,700 streamflow gauges.
R-ArcticNET was used by \citet{Shiklomanov_2009} in their investigation of increasing river discharge in the largest Eurasian rivers and by \citep{Tan_2011} in their investigation of changes in spring snowmelt timing.
\citet{Dai_2009} extended portions of the R-ArcticNET database through 2007 at coastal streamflow gauges.
\citet{Adam_2007, Adam_2008, Su_2007, Dai_2009} all have used uncoupled land surface models, in conjunction with routing schemes to simulate streamflow across the pan-Arctic region.
These studies have all led to improved understanding of the terestrial hydroclimate in the Arctic and how the seasonal streamflow dyanmics in the arctic basin respond to changes in climate and water management activities.
However, there has not been significant research applied to understanding the role of streamflow in coupled processes in the Arctic.


% [other climate models that include coupled land-ocean dynamics]
Previous studies have included streamflow routing models within coupled climate models.
Cell-to-cell routing methods, such as the River Transport Model \citep[RTM][]{Branstetter_2003} have been applied globally in a number of GCMs, including the Community Earth System Model [CESM].
These cell-to-cell models are typically difficult to parameterize across a range of spatial scales \citep{Sushama_2004}.
\citep{Olivera_2000} introduced a similar source-to-sink streamflow routing model as the one used in the RVIC model.
Source-to-sink routing methods do not explicitly track streamflow between grid cells, rather they parameterize the distribution and travel time of runoff between the source grid cell and the outlet grid cell.
However, in recent years, the literature has been mostly silent in terms of development of streamflow routing schemes coupled within earth system models.
In fact, \citet{Bring_2015}, in their synthesis of CMIP5 runoff dynamics, conclude that a significant community effort should be made to improve the understanding and modeling of basin scale freshwater fluxes in coupled climate modeling.

In this paper, we describe the land-ocean coupling in the Regional Arctic System Model [RASM, see section~\ref{sec:rasm}].
We introduce the RVIC streamflow routing model and present results from fully-coupled RASM simulations where the land and ocean are coupled via the runoff flux.
The analysis presented here compares simulated streamflow to observations at streamflow gauging locations and explores the role of the terestrial freshwater flux in the ice-ocean components of the climate system.

\section{Models}

\subsection{RASM}
\label{sec:rasm}

The Regional Arctic System Model [RASM] is a fully coupled, high spatial and high temporal resolution regional earth system model applied over the pan-Arctic domain.
RASM has recently been developed under the support of the Department of Energy Earth System Modeling program.
Principle goals of the modeling project are to better understand the interaction between physical systems in the Arctic drainage basin, to advance understanding of past and present states of Arctic climate, and to improve seasonal to multi-decadal prediction capabilities of key Arctic indicators.
Existing model components, typically run off-line of one another are coupled using the CESM coupled model framework and the CPL7 flux coupler \citep{Craig_2011}.
Below, we provide a brief description of the five component models in RASM version 1.0.
The reader is encouraged to see the cited RASM specific references for more information on the specific implementation of individual component models.
For the purposes of this paper, we are principally concerned with the coastal streamflow flux and its role in the Arctic Ocean system, therefore our description below mainly focuses on the streamflow and ocean model components.

\begin{enumerate}
\item CICE: The Los Alamos Sea Ice model \citep{Hunke_2010} is physically based dynamic sea ice model.
\citet{Roberts_2015b} provide a description of the application of CICE, version 5, within RASM.
\item POP: The Parallel Ocean Program model \citep{Smith_2010} is a general circulation ocean model.
Osinski et al. [Manuscript in Preparation] provide a description of the application of POP, version 2, within RASM.
Of particular relavance to this study, POP uses a virtual salinity flux to represent changes in ocean salinty due to surface fluxes of freshwater (runoff, precipitation, and evaporation). [<<Robert to expand here as needed>>]
\item VIC: The Variable Infiltration Capacity model \citep{Liang_1996} is a macroscale land surface hydrology model.
\citet{Hamman_2015} provide a description of the application of VIC, version 4, within RASM.
\item WRF: The Weather Research and Forecasting atmospheric model \citep{Skamarock_2007} is a mesoscale meteorological model.
Cassano et al. [Manuscript in Preparation] provide a detailed description of the WRF model, version 3.2, as it is applied in RASM.
\item RVIC: The RVIC streamflow routing model is an adapted version of the \citet{Lohmann_1996} linear routing model frequently used to route the runoff flux from the VIC model.
A complete description of the RVIC model is provided in section~\ref{sec:rvic}.
\end{enumerate}

In RASM Version 1.0, the land, atmosphere, and runoff components share a 50-km near-equal-area North Pole stereographic grid mesh.
The ocean and sea ice models share a 1/12$^{\circ}$ rotated stereographic grid mesh.
Models are coupled every 20 minutes in the configuration described by \citet{Roberts_2015a}.

\subsection{RVIC}
\label{sec:rvic}

The RVIC streamflow routing model is a modified version of the routing model typically used to post-process VIC model output \citep{Lohmann_1996, Lohmann_1998a}.
The original \citet{Lohmann_1996} model has been used in many offline modeling studies across spatial scales from 1/16$^{\circ}$ to 2$^{\circ}$ \citep[.e.g.][]{Nijssen_1997,Lohmann_1998b,Su_2005}.
RVIC is a source-to-sink model that solves a linearized version of the Saint-Venant equations.
The model has two distinct steps, the preprocessing step where linear time invariant impulse response functions (IRFs) are developed (see sections ~\ref{sec:irfs} and ~\ref{sec:remap}), and a the convolution step where distributed runoff from the land surface model is routed to downstream points (see section~\ref{sec:convolution}).

The RVIC model differs from the original \citet{Lohmann_1996} model in four main ways:

\begin{enumerate}
\item RVIC completely separates the development of the IRFs from the flow convolution step,
\item RVIC allows the development of the IRFs to be done on flow direction grids that do not match that of the land model (see section~\ref{sec:irfs}),
\item The RVIC convolution scheme operates in a space-before-time pattern, facilitating direct coupling with land surface models (see section~\ref{sec:convolution}),
\item RVIC includes numerous infrastructure improvements, including the ability to store the model state and to read and write netCDF files.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Impulse response function development}
\label{sec:irfs}

The source-to-sink response of flow from any model grid cell to a downstream point is represented as a linear and time invariant response to an impulse of runoff.
Therefore, the development of the IRF between any source and sink points may be described as a function of the horizontal travel time of water within the source grid cell and to the downstream point with the addition of a flow diffusion parameter.
The horizontal travel distance is computed using a flow direction raster \citep[e.g.][]{Wu_2011}
The Saint-Venant equation

 \begin{equation}
     \frac{\partial Q}{\partial t} = D \frac{\partial^2 Q}{\partial x} + C \frac{\partial Q}{\partial x}
 \end{equation}

represents the flow $Q$, at time $t$, at a downstream point $x$, as a function of the wave velocity, $C$, and the diffusivity, $D$; both of which may be estimated from geographical data.

Eq. (1) can be solved with convolution integrals

 \begin{equation}
	Q(x,t) = \int_0^t U(t-s)h(x,s)ds
 \end{equation}

where

 \begin{equation}
	h(x, t) = \frac{x}{2t\sqrt{\pi tD}}exp\left(-\frac{(Ct-x)^2}{4Dt}\right)
 \end{equation}

is Green’s impulse response function, and $U$ is a unit hydrograph representing the distribution of flow from within each source grid cell to the edge of of the source grid cell.
The Saint-Venant equations are solved to determine flow response from every source to outlet pair.

\subsubsection{Upscaling and basin aggregation}
\label{sec:remap}

The development of the impulse response functions may be done on a high resolution (e.g. 1/16$^{\circ}$) flow network such as the one developed by \citet{Wu_2011}.
Whereas the typical employment of the \citet{Lohmann_1996} model requires that the flow direction grid and the land surface model grid match exactly, the RVIC implementation first upscales and aggregates the high resolution IRF grid to the land surface model grid [Figure 2].
The upscaling process uses the first-order conservative remapping technique developed by \citep{Jones_1999}.
Because the remapping scheme is conservative, the unit response to runoff (unit hydrograph) from each source grid cell is maintained.
Finally, the regridded IRFs are aggregated to include all basins flowing into a single outlet grid cell.

\subsubsection{Convolution}
\label{sec:convolution}

Once the development of the IRFs complete, RVIC performs a simple linear convolution of the IRFs and runoff fluxes from the land model.
In essence, RVIC aggregates the flow contribution from all upstream grid cells at every timestep, distributing them in time according the IRF.

\subsection{Coupling}
\label{sec:coupling}

In nature, turbulent mixing and other diffusive processes combine to gradually spread freshwater along the coast and into the open ocean.
In a coupled modeling environment however, these processes are difficult to represent at the spatial resolution that ocean and sea ice models are run at.
To simulate the dispersion of freshwater throughout each ocean grid cell within RASM, a diffusion scheme is applied to avoid unrealistic salinity gradients that would occur when a river’s entire outflow is applied to one ocean grid cell.
The mapping from the runoff grid to the ocean grid is produced as a preprocessing step using the runoff and ocean grids and masks.
Each runoff gridcell is mapped to the nearest ocean grid cell.
The flux is then smoothed over all gridpoints in a 300 km radius with distance weighting e-folding scale of 1000 km such that the total quantity is conserved from runoff to ocean.
This smoothing prevents excessively large and unrealistic runoff fluxes into any single ocean grid cell and encourages computational stability within the ocean model while representing the distributed changes in salinity due to the land-ocean freshwater flux.

\subsubsection{RVIC in RASM}

The IRFs used in RASM were developed using the \citet{Wu_2011} 1/16$^{\circ}$ flow direction rasters.
The baseline RASM simulation used a spatially constant flow velocity and diffusion of 0.6 m/s and a 3,000 m$^2$/s, respectively.
These parameters were choosen using the calibration methods described below in section~\ref{sec:parameters}.
IRFs were developed for every coastal 1/16$^{\circ}$ grid cell bordering the ocean model, and were aggregated and remapped onto the 50-km near equal area land surface grid.

\subsection{Parameter Selection}
\label{sec:parameters}

A brute force parameter selection proceedure was performed to select the velocity and diffusion parameters for the RVIC model applied in RASM.
The velocity parameter was varied between 0.2 and 1.5 m/s and the diffusion was veried between 500 and 4,000 m2/s.
Individual pairs of parameters were evaluated using a modified version of the overlap statistic \citet{Perkins_2012}.
The overlap statistic, which was originally introduced as a measure of likeness for prbability density functions, is applied here to the normalized mean monthly hydrographs of the six largest river basins in the study domain from RASM and the observations from \citet{Dai_2009} [figure].
The pair of velocity and diffusions parameters, x and y respectively, was choosen to maximize the volume weighted composite overlap statisc for the largest six rivers in the RASM domain [figure].

\section{Model Simulations and Data}

In this paper, we present results from three RASM simulations, each using ERA-Interim boundary conditions, $RASM-CONTROL$, $RASM-FAST$, and $RASM-NOROF$ using RASM version 1.0.
All three simulation were run from September 1, 1979 through December 31, 2014, however we use an analysis period of January 1, 1990 and December 31, 2009, allowing for a 10 year model spinnup.
All three simulations uses the same land, atmosphere, ocean, and sea ice model configurations and only differ in the following ways:
\begin{itemize}
\item $RASM_CONTROL$: uses the calibrated RVIC parameters described above.
\item $RASM-FAST$ uses RVIC velocity and diffusion parameters of 2.0 m/s and 2,000 m2/s.
\item $RASM-NOROF$ does not include the runoff flux from the land to the ocean.
\end{itemize}

We compare output from RASM simulations to streamflow observations in the \citet{Dai_2009} dataset.
This dataset provides mean monthly streamflow observations at the most downstream gauging location for 130 individual river basins within the RASM domain and analysis period.
The period of record for each basin varies and only basins that included observations between 1990 and 2009 were included.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Coupled streamflow routing results}

Our analysis of the annual streamflow hydrograph extends the results of \citet{Hamman_2015} to the monthly timescale.
Figure X shows the RVIC routed annual hydrograph at six select streamflow gauge locations, compared to observations, and to the unrouted runoff flux.
At each of these streamflow gauge locations, RASM simulates the spring freshet in May or June, although typically peaking a month prior to the observations.

Figure Xa compares the fraction of the annual flow volume that occurs between April and July between the $RASM_CONTROL$ simulation and the observations.
Figure Xb compares the center of mass of the annual hydrograph between the $RASM_CONTROL$ and $RASM-FAST$ simulation and the observations.
% TODO:
% Make scatter plots of April-July fractional volume, centroid of timing (RASM vs obs).
% Make table showing same data for selection of main rivers.

\subsection{Role of high resolution coastal streamflow on ocean and sea ice dynamics}

We begin by exploring the influence of coastal streamflow on the surface salinity and temperature in individual ocean basins.
We compare the two fully coupled simulations ($RASM_CONTROL$) with one partially coupled simulation ($RASM-NOROF$).
In each of the four ocean basins shown in Figure X, the simulations including the runoff flux to the ocean lower the salinity in the surface layer of the ocean between 1-3 g/kg.
Accompanying the lower salinty, is a shift in the annual temperature cycle in the surface layer with a general reduction in temperature in the summer months.

This section to be completed after analysis of ocean/sea ice model results.
\begin{itemize}
\item Comparison between RB case with surface restoring to fully coupled RBR case.
\item Coastal ocean circulation in RB / RBR cases
\item Sea ice production as a function of salinity changes
\item Sea ice thickness distribution over decadal timescales, connections to freshwater fluxes.
\end{itemize}

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Large Scale Arctic Freshwater Budget}
The addition of RVIC within RASM has allowed us to close the large scale freshwater budget in central Arctic.
Figure X presents the major fluxes and storages between the land, ocean, and atmosphere components in RASM, and compares them to the values presented in \citet{Serreze_2006}.
As also shown by \citet{Hamman_2015}, the biases in precipitation over land and runoff to the central Arctic are relatively low, compared to observations and reanalysis products.
The precipitation and evaporation fluxes over the ocean are much less constrained than those over land.
In general, RASM tends to have less precipitation and evporation over the cetral Arctic ocean.
Place holder for discussion about ocean fluxes.
[<<Move to another paper?>> ]

\subsection{Routing Processes}
The RVIC model is a source-to-sink linear routing model that uses time-invarient IRFs to route streamflow to coastal grid cells in RASM.
At present, there is no mechanism in the RVIC model to account for non-linear routing processes such as overbank flow, wetlands, ice jams, reservoir operations, and industrial or aggricultural withdrawls.
\citet{Adam_2007} highlight the importance of representing the reservoir influences in order to capture the annual hydrograph in some Eurasian rivers.
Errors caused by not explicitly representing these processes are aparrent, for example, in the Nelson River [figure X] where RVIC produces a naturalized hydrograph that does not resemble the observed hydrograph which is highly influenced by reservoir operations.
Ice dam dynamics during the spring melt are also not well represneted using a linear routing model, however, due to the timestep of the results here, we do not believe these processes contribute significantly to the errors in stremflow timing.

While the initial implementation of the RVIC model coupled within RASM completes the freshwater cycle, it does not provide mechanisms to deterministically route other runoff properties, such as heat content, nutrients, or sediments.
Previous studies \citep[e.g.][]{vanVliet_2011,vanVliet_2012}, using the original \citet{Lohmann_1996} model, have included coupled representation of water temperature.
Other work, currently underway aims to add the representation of other water quality tracers.

%  SECTION HEADS
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%

% Capitalize the first letter of each word (except for
% prepositions, conjunctions, and articles that are
% three or fewer letters).

% AGU follows standard outline style; therefore, there cannot be a section 1 without
% a section 2, or a section 2.3.1 without a section 2.3.2.
% Please make sure your section numbers are balanced.
% ---------------
% Level 1 head
%
% Use the \section{} command to identify level 1 heads;
% type the appropriate head wording between the curly
% brackets, as shown below.
%
%An example:
%\section{Level 1 Head: Introduction}
%
% ---------------
% Level 2 head
%
% Use the \subsection{} command to identify level 2 heads.
%An example:
%\subsection{Level 2 Head}
%
% ---------------
% Level 3 head
%
% Use the \subsubsection{} command to identify level 3 heads
%An example:
%\subsubsection{Level 3 Head}
%
%---------------
% Level 4 head
%
% Use the \subsubsubsection{} command to identify level 3 heads
% An example:
%\subsubsubsection{Level 4 Head} An example.

%  EQUATIONS
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%

% Single-line equations are centered.
% Equation arrays will appear left-aligned.

Math coded inside display math mode \[ ...\]
 will not be numbered, e.g.,:
 \[ x^2=y^2 + z^2\]

 Math coded inside \begin{equation} and \end{equation} will
 be automatically numbered, e.g.,:
 \begin{equation}
 x^2=y^2 + z^2
 \end{equation}

% IF YOU HAVE MULTI-LINE EQUATIONS, PLEASE
% BREAK THE EQUATIONS INTO TWO OR MORE LINES
% OF SINGLE COLUMN WIDTH (20 pc, 8.3 cm)
% using double backslashes (\\).

% To create multiline equations, use the
% \begin{eqnarray} and \end{eqnarray} environment
% as demonstrated below.
\begin{eqnarray}
  x_{1} & = & (x - x_{0}) \cos \Theta \nonumber \\
        && + (y - y_{0}) \sin \Theta  \nonumber \\
  y_{1} & = & -(x - x_{0}) \sin \Theta \nonumber \\
        && + (y - y_{0}) \cos \Theta.
\end{eqnarray}

%If you don't want an equation number, use the star form:
%\begin{eqnarray*}...\end{eqnarray*}

% Break each line at a sign of operation
% (+, -, etc.) if possible, with the sign of operation
% on the new line.

% Indent second and subsequent lines to align with
% the first character following the equal sign on the
% first line.

% Use an \hspace{} command to insert horizontal space
% into your equation if necessary. Place an appropriate
% unit of measure between the curly braces, e.g.
% \hspace{1in}; you may have to experiment to achieve
% the correct amount of space.


%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%
%
%  EQUATION NUMBERING: COUNTER
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%

% You may change equation numbering by resetting
% the equation counter or by explicitly numbering
% an equation.

% To explicitly number an equation, type \eqnum{}
% (with the desired number between the brackets)
% after the \begin{equation} or \begin{eqnarray}
% command.  The \eqnum{} command will affect only
% the equation it appears with; LaTeX will number
% any equations appearing later in the manuscript
% according to the equation counter.
%

% If you have a multiline equation that needs only
% one equation number, use a \nonumber command in
% front of the double backslashes (\\) as shown in
% the multiline equation above.

% For tables and figures, add \usepackage{rotating} to the paper and add the rotating.sty file to the folder.
% AGU prefers the use of {sidewaystable} over {landscapetable} as it causes fewer problems.
